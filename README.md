# 📚 Library Management System (Python OOP Project)

This project is a simple yet effective **Library Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python. It allows users to manage a collection of books, enabling roles for both **Admin** and **Student** with respective functionalities like adding, deleting, borrowing, and returning books.

## ✨ Project Description

This command-line Python application simulates a real-world library system. It demonstrates core OOP principles such as **Encapsulation**, **Classes and Objects**, and **Data Persistence using JSON**.

There are two types of users:
- **Admin**: Can add, view, or delete books.
- **Student**: Can view, borrow, or return books.

Book data is stored persistently in a JSON file, so updates remain even after the program ends.
